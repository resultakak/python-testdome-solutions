Implement function count_numbers that accepts a sorted list of unique integers and, **efficiently** with respect to time used, counts the number of list elements that are less than the parameter less_than.

For example, count_numbers([1, 3, 5, 7], 4) should return 2 because there are two list elements less than 4.

```python
def count_numbers(sorted_list, less_than):
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sorted_list = [1, 3, 5, 7]
    print(count_numbers(sorted_list, 4)) # should print 2
```
